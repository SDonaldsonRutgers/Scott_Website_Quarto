    "text": "“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” – Peter Drucker\n\nI train students for careers in public health, psychology, and evaluation through the theory and practice of measurement, applied research methods, and biostatistics. I approach each course as a 15-week professional development experience, equipping students with real-world skills they can use in research, practice, or policy roles. With the average person working 90,000 hours over a lifetime, my goal is to make those hours more impactful and meaningful.\nMy courses are student-centered, practical, and designed for immediate application. I integrate lectures with experiential activities, role-playing, and real-world examples from my consulting and research work. Students learn to use tools such as R, SAS, SPSS, AMOS, and Qualtrics to design surveys, analyze data, and create effective data visualizations. I also emphasize the art of translating findings into clear, accessible insights—what I call “business talk”—so students can confidently present data to decision-makers.\nTeaching effectiveness is measured by more than grades. I track how well students are prepared to apply what they’ve learned in their careers. Through career-focused advising, end-of-semester feedback sessions, and resume/CV consultations, I continuously improve my courses to ensure long-term impact.\nIn short, I aim to develop technically skilled, critically engaged, and career-ready professionals who use data to make a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Professor, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (2024–Present)\nResearch mentorship across internal medicine and population health\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjunct Professor, Research Methods, Measurement, and Evaluation (2023–Present)\nCourses taught: Graduate-level statistics, advanced program evaluation, evaluation practicum\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjunct Professor, Keck School of Medicine (2022)\nCourses taught: Graduate-level biostatistics\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjunct Professor, School of Leadership and Education Sciences (2021)\nCourses taught: Graduate-level research methods\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjunct Professor, Crean College of Health & Behavioral Sciences (2018–2019)\nCourses taught: Undergraduate statistics and research methods\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjunct Professor, Department of Psychology (2017–2018)\nCourses taught: Undergraduate statistics and research methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I have never had a more organized, practical, understandable, and helpful class. I was not looking forward to this course at all because I already had to take it for my SCC major and it was pretty tough. Professor Donaldson made this difficult class easy to understand, and I learned more about research methods than I did in my first class. Professor Donaldson was always willing to help and just truly wants his students to learn. I am confident that I can go out into the real world and apply the skills I learned from this class. The assignments made sense and overall layout of the syllabus was great. I loved how we had the lecture in the first half of the class, then had activities and experiments to directly apply what we just learned in the last half of class. It helped absorb the information much easier.

    "text": "“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” – Peter Drucker\n\nI train students for careers in public health, psychology, and evaluation through the theory and practice of measurement, applied research methods, and biostatistics. I approach each course as a 15-week professional development experience, equipping students with real-world skills they can use in research, practice, or policy roles. With the average person working 90,000 hours over a lifetime, my goal is to make those hours more impactful and meaningful.\nMy courses are student-centered, practical, and designed for immediate application. I integrate lectures with experiential activities, role-playing, and real-world examples from my consulting and research work. Students learn to use tools such as R, SAS, SPSS, AMOS, and Qualtrics to design surveys, analyze data, and create effective data visualizations. I also emphasize the art of translating findings into clear, accessible insights—what I call “business talk”—so students can confidently present data to decision-makers.\nTeaching effectiveness is measured by more than grades. I track how well students are prepared to apply what they’ve learned in their careers. Through career-focused advising, end-of-semester feedback sessions, and resume/CV consultations, I continuously improve my courses to ensure long-term impact.\nIn short, I aim to develop technically skilled, critically engaged, and career-ready professionals who use data to make a difference."
